## About Tigerbotics

Tigerbotics is the Glen Rose High School Robotics Team.
We were formed in the fall of 2017. Our first year consisted of 12 9th-12th grade students competing in the BEST Robotics Competition in the fall.
The very next school year we expanded to also compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition in the spring.
We have been competing in these two events ever since. We are active on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/tigerbotics), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/tigerbotics), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tigerbotics).

## Our Competitions

### BEST

BEST stands for Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology.
BEST is a low cost, small scale robotics competition.
Students can only use the provided materials to build a competition robot that meets restrictive constraints.
For example, the robot must weigh under 24 pounds, fit within a 2 foot cube, and have limits on how they modify the components.
The students are given a strict six week time limit from the reveal of the game to the competition date. Mentors are restricted to an advisory role.

The BEST Robotics Competition is part of UIL Robotics. BEST kicks off early September.
We compete in the Cowtown BEST regional competition in November.
If we advance, we compete in the BEST in the UIL State Championship in December.

### FIRST

</div>

FIRST stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.
FIRST is a high cost, large scale robotics competition.
The robot can be up to 120 pounds, have a frame perimeter of 120 inches, and include a variety of approved components with a fair market value of less than $600 each.
Students are encouraged to use cutting edge technology, including hardware and software components.
Common, off the shelf components are allowed in the design, but students must integrate them themselves.
The complexity of FIRST is tenfold when compared to BEST. The students are exposed to more difficult problems to design solutions for.
Mentors are able to provide more direct assistance in both fabrication and design.

The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is the second half of UIL Robotics. The competition kicks off at the start of January.
We compete in two district competitions to earn “District Points” during the months of March and April. Each district competition will host anywhere from 30-60 teams.
As of 2022, Texas has 164 teams in the state. Roughly 80 teams, the top teams in our district are invited to the FRC/UIL State Championship in April.
Following this roughly 600 teams, the highest caliper teams from all around the world, will go to the world championship competition 2 weeks later.

## More Than STEM
For both of these competitions, students are asked to do more than design a robot.
They need to develop their communication skills, by marketing their robot to judges and other teams.
Students design banners, logos, and shirts for each competition, and even create animations and videos that exhibit team pride and artistic skills.
