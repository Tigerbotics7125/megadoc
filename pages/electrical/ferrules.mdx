# Wire Ferrules

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">Ferrules should only be used on **stranded wire**!</Callout>

A wire ferrule is a metal tube crimped over **stranded wire** to secure the strands together.
Some may have electrical insulation to protect against any exposed conductor.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">Ferrules may cause a voltage drop under high load, due to most connection methods having minimal contact area with them, which should be taken into consideration.</Callout>

Ferrules come in many sizes, such as these:
- 20 AWG (am-3738_20)

- 18 AWG (am-3738_18)

- 16 AWG (am-3738_16)

- 12 AWG (am-3738_12)

Some ferrules may come without insulation, such as this 12 AWG ferrule (am-2027).

Ferrules should be crimped with an appropiate crimping tool (am-3739), and always tug-tested.
