# Wire Ferrules

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">Ferrules should only be used on **stranded wire**!</Callout>

A wire ferrule is a metal tube crimped over **stranded wire** to secure the strands together.
Some may have electrical insulation to protect against any exposed conductor.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">Ferrules may cause a voltage drop under high load, due to most connection methods having minimal contact area with them, which should be taken into consideration.</Callout>

## Variants & Vendors

Ferrules come in many sizes, such as these:

## Tools

Ferrules should be crimped with an appropriate crimping tool [AM-3739](https://www.andymark.com/products/ferrule-crimp-tool).

**Remember to always tug-test electrical crimps and connections.**

## Usage

Steps to crimping a ferrule:
1. Strip your ***stranded wire*** the same length as the contact portion of your ferrule.
2. Insert the strands of wire into an appropriately sized wire ferrule.
3. Insert the wire ferrule, which is over the stranded wire, into the crimp-tool.
4. Crimp the wire ferrule, this should affix the wire ferrule onto the wire.
5. Tug-test the wire ferrule.
