# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

In Laymen's terms: Markdown's purpose is to use plain-text, which is easily human readable, to *mark up* the content (hence the name Mark*down*) into pretty to read content, such as this website.

Markdown is an alternative to something like HTML - HyperText Markup Language (the language used to describe how your web-page appears in your browser) which is practically incomprehensible to understand unless you are an alien, or perhaps Mark Zuckerberg?

Actually Markdown is able to be converted into HTML (what this project does!) instead of making you write HTML.

You can read in detail everything there is to know about Markdown [here](https://github.github.com/gfm), but the following examples should show you the basics and get you started writing basic pages immediately. Just a reminder, nothing is easy at first, give yourself some time to figure out how Markdown works.

## Headings

Headings are large bold text elements, they should be used only as headings and [text formatting](#basic-text-formatting) should be used for plain-text. There are only 6 levels of headings.

Level 1 headings should only be used once per page, as the title of the page.

### Example

# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
### Level 3 Heading
#### Level 4 Heading
##### Level 5 Heading
###### Level 6 Heading

### Usage

```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
### Level 3 Heading
#### Level 4 Heading
##### Level 5 Heading
###### Level 6 Heading
```

## Basic Text Formatting

Basic text can be written as expected, plain-text; text formatting, like italics, bold, and strikethrough are still possible.

### Example
Regular text, *italic text,* **bold text,** ~~strikethrough text,~~ ***italic-bold text,*** ~~*italic-strikethrough text,*~~ ~~**bold-strikethrough text,**~~ ~~***italic-bold-strikethrough text.***~~

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
Regular text, *italic text,* **bold text,** ~~strikethrough text,~~ ***italic-bold text,*** ~~*italic-strikethrough text,*~~ ~~**bold-strikethrough text,**~~ ~~***italic-bold-strikethrough text.***~~
```

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs can be written as consecutive non-blank lines. A blank line between lines of text will create a new paragraph.

### Example
aaa
bbb

ccc
ddd

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
aaa
bbb

ccc
ddd
```

## Thematic Break

You can insert a line across the page to give a visual break between topics or long sections. These are automatically entered under level 2 [headings](#headings)

### Example

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"

## Tables

A table is an arrangement of data with rows and columns.

Tables consist of a header row, a delimiter row, and zero or more data rows.

A delimiter row consists of cells whose only content are hyphens, or optionally a leading, or trailing colon (`:`), or both, to indicate, left, right, or center alignment respectively.

### Example

| Left              | Middle             | Right              |
| :---------------- | :----------------: | -----------------: |
| Foo-Bar           | Biz-Fiz            | Buzz-Fuzz          |
| Bar-Foo           | Fiz-Biz            | Fuzz-Buzz          |
| Super-Long-Fooooo | Super-Long-Bizzzzz | Super-Long-Fuzzzzz |

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
| Left              | Middle             | Right              |
| :---------------- | :----------------: | -----------------: |
| Foo-Bar           | Biz-Fiz            | Buzz-Fuzz          |
| Bar-Foo           | Fiz-Biz            | Fuzz-Buzz          |
| Super-Long-Fooooo | Super-Long-Bizzzzz | Super-Long-Fuzzzzz |
```

## Block Quotes

A block quote is marked with a `>` followed by the desired text.

### Example

> A silly little quote.

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
> A silly little quote.
```

## Lists

Bulleted lists can be created with `-`, `+`, or `*` characters.

Ordered lists can be created with a sequence of 1-9 digits `0-9` followed by either `.` or `)`.

Main list items start at the beginning of a line, sub items inset 4 spaces (or 1 tab) from their parent item.

### Example
- Milk
- Eggs
- Video Games
    1. Super Mario Bros
        - SMB 1
        - SMB 3
    2. Battletoads
    3. Minecraft

1. Go to the store
2. Get the items
3. Pay for the items
    - Optional
4. Go home

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
- Milk
- Eggs
- Video Games
    1. Super Mario Bros
        - SMB 1
        - SMB 3
    2. Battletoads
    3. Minecraft

1. Go to the store
2. Get the items
3. Pay for the items
    - Optional
4. Go home
```

## Links

Links can be declared with a set of square brackets `[ ]` followed by a pair of parenthesis `( )`.

Link text goes within the square brackets, and the link references goes within the parenthesis.

### Example
[Tigerbotics' Amazing Website.](https://tigerbotics.org)

[Google](https://www.google.com) is a great place to look for solutions.

### Usage
```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
[Tigerbotics' Amazing Website.](https://tigerbotics.org)

[Google](https://www.google.com) is a great place to look for solutions.
```

## Images

Images are very similar to links, simply prefaced with an exclamation point `!`.

Instead of link text however, it is alt text, which will be shown if the image fails to load.

Images can also be wrapped within links, making clickable images.

### Example
![Tigerbotics' logo](/favicon-512x512.png)

This one will take you to the Tigerbotics home page.

### Usage

```md showLineNumbers filename="Markdown"
![Tigerbotics' logo](/favicon-512x512.png)

This one will take you to the Tigerbotics home page.
