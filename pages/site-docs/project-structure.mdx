# Understanding the Project's File Structure

The file structure of the project may seem convoluted initially, this document should help alleviate any confusion about the structure and explain some of the basic files you will encounter.

Here is an example file tree which represents a basic project.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="project" defaultOpen>

        <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
            <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
            <FileTree.File name="some-other-page.mdx"/>

            <FileTree.Folder name="some-collection">
                <FileTree.File name="_meta.json"/>
                <FileTree.File name="part-of-the-collection.mdx"/>
                <FileTree.File name="another-part.mdx"/>
            </FileTree.Folder>

            <FileTree.Folder name="another-collection">
                <FileTree.File name="_meta.json"/>
                <FileTree.File name="a-platypus.mdx"/>
                <FileTree.File name="perry-the-platypus.mdx"/>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>

        <FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="any-ol-image.png"/>
            <FileTree.File name="ooh-look-an-svg.svg"/>
            <FileTree.File name="really-just-any-images.gif"/>
        </FileTree.Folder>

    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

There are more files than shown in the file tree, but most of them should not be modified unless you are a programmer, and you know what you're doing.

The project contains two main folders, the `pages/` folder, and the `public/` folder, the following sections will describe the purpose of each.

## The `pages/` Folder
The `pages/` folder contains *the meat* of the project, it contains Markdown files and metadata files, both of which are used together to generate the content of the website.

### Markdown
You can learn more about [Markdown](./markdown) and [MDX](./md-extension) in their respective documentation page.

Every Markdown file generates its own page on the website, by default they will be shown in the sidebar in alphabetical order, with the same name as their filename.
These aspects can be changed with metadata, read on to learn how.

### Metadata
Stored in `_meta.json` files, there should be **one, and only one**, within each folder / directory of the `pages/` folder.

`_meta.json` files are able to change many aspects about the website.
Most commonly (and simply), the name of pages, and their order in the sidebar are configured.

When a page (or pages) is declared in the `_meta.json` file, it will appear in the sidebar in the same order that it appears in the `_meta.json` file.
This does mean a page can be shown in the sidebar with no Markdown file to represent it. If this occurs, clicking on the item will simply do nothing.
This is good for having placeholder pages which you would like to fill out later.

Pages can also be renamed via the `_meta.json` file.
This allows for concise file names, but more verbose page names.
If you do not wish to change the page name you can simply provide an empty string `""`, this will still define the pages order in the sidebar.

here is an example `_meta.json` file:
```json filename="_meta.json"
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "about": "About Us"
}
```
In this example, the `contact.mdx` page would be shown as `Contact Us` in the sidebar, while the link to this page would remain as https://example.com/contact.

**For more information on the `_meta.json` file and what else it can do, see [here](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/organize-files#_metajson).**

## The `public/` folder
The `public/` folder is where any server side content should be stored.
This means files such as images, gifs, or videos should go in this folder.

You can reference files in the `public/` folder as if the base `public/` and `pages/` directories were the same place.
You can see an example of this [here](./markdown#images).
