# Required Accounts, Software, & Applications

This page is a step-by-step guide on how to create, install, and download all necessary accounts, software, and applications required to work on the website.

<Steps>
### Create A [GitHub](https://github.com) account

GitHub is used as a "remote repository", in Layman's terms, GitHub keeps all of our files, and stores them on their servers, where we can access them.
Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) to setup your account.

### Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Do not confuse ***git*** with ***GitHub***, git is a "Global Information Tracker", which essentially means that it keeps track of who makes what changes to any and all files in our project. GitHub however, is simply a website which stores our files, and is built around the concept of git.
[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lt9oDAvpG4I?t=47&si=M7gvBus8g-FXsEFT) should show you how to install git.

<Callout type="info">If you ***do not*** have administrative privileges on your computer, you will need to use the ***portable*** version of git.</Callout>

### Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) meaning it is designed to help you write code (or other files in this case).

<Callout type="info">Steps 4, and 5 are only necessary if you want to run the website on your computer, this requires having administrative privileges however. If you do not have administrative privileges, you can still preview the website, it is just less convenient. You can find more info [here](##7-creating-a-pull-request--previewing-your-changes).</Callout>

### Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

Node.js is the code that runs the web server.

### Download and install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

pnpm is a package manager, which manages dependencies for the project.

### Restart your computer

It is a good idea to restart your computer to ensure all applications are fresh.
